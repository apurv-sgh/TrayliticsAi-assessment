# CareerLens AI

CareerLens AI compares a resume with a job description and explains the alignment using explicit evidence. It identifies strong matches, partial/unclear matches, missing requirements, score components, and next-step recommendations.

## Features

- PDF and DOCX resume upload with MIME and 5 MB limits.
- Deterministic resume/JD extraction and skill normalization (`React.js` -> `React`, `Mongo` -> `MongoDB`, `JS` -> `JavaScript`).
- Evidence-based matching. Missing skills are reported as **not clearly present**, never inferred as owned.
- Configurable weighted compatibility score for required skills, preferred skills, experience, keywords, and education.
- Optional server-side Gemini explanation and recommendation layer with deterministic fallback.
- Persisted resumes and analyses for authenticated users.
- Demo analysis endpoint for presentations without an account.
- Socket.io event emitted after a persisted analysis is created.
- Responsive SaaS dashboard with score visualization, skill chips, chart, evidence rows, loading states, and actionable errors.

### Folder structure

- `src/`: React dashboard and visual system.
- `server/index.js`: Express, Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, Socket.io, and error handling.
- `server/routes/`: auth, history/metrics, and analysis endpoints.
- `server/services/`: document parsing, extraction, normalization, matching, scoring, and AI.
- `server/models/`: Mongoose User, Resume, and Analysis schemas.
- `server/validators/`: Zod request schemas.
- `test/`: Node test runner coverage for normalization, matching, evidence, and score bounds.

## Stack

React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Recharts, Lucide, Express 5, MongoDB/Mongoose, Multer, PDF Parse, Mammoth, Socket.io, JWT, Helmet, express-rate-limit, Zod, and Gemini SDK.

## Local setup

```powershell
npm install
Copy-Item .env.example .env
npm run dev:full
```

The frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`. The API runs on `http://localhost:4000`. MongoDB is required for registration, authenticated uploads, and persistence. The demo endpoint works without MongoDB.

Useful commands:

```powershell
npm run dev          # frontend
npm run server:dev   # API with nodemon
npm run dev:full     # both
npm run build        # production frontend build
npm run lint         # Oxlint
npm test             # matching service tests
```

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set:

- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string.
- `JWT_SECRET`: long random secret; required for auth.
- `PORT`: API port, default `4000`.
- `CLIENT_URL`: allowed frontend origin.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: optional server-only Gemini key.
- `GEMINI_MODEL`: optional model name.
- `SCORING_WEIGHTS_JSON`: optional JSON object overriding score weights.

Never put Gemini keys, JWT secrets, or MongoDB credentials in `src/` or commit them.

## API

Public:

- `GET /api/health`
- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `GET /api/analyze/demo`

Authenticated with the HTTP-only `access_token` cookie:

- `GET /api/auth/me`
- `POST /api/analyze` with multipart fields `resume`, `roleTitle`, `company`, and `jobDescription`.
- `GET /api/analyses?search=&status=&sort=`
- `GET /api/analyses/:id`
- `GET /api/analyses/metrics`
- `DELETE /api/analyses/:id`

The server calculates the score after extraction and matching. Clients cannot submit a trusted score.

## AI behavior

Gemini is isolated in `server/services/aiService.js` and only receives structured profiles/comparison data. Its output is parsed and constrained to a summary plus recommendations. Invalid JSON, rate limits, missing keys, timeouts, and provider errors fall back to deterministic explanations. Gemini never writes to MongoDB and never determines the final score.

## Security

- HTTP-only, same-site auth cookie.
- Password hashing with bcrypt.
- Helmet security headers and CORS origin restriction.
- API rate limiting.
- Multer memory upload with MIME, extension, file-count, and size validation.
- Zod validation for analysis metadata.
- Escaped search expressions and allow-listed sort fields.
- Sanitized error responses without stack traces or resume contents.
- Resume raw text is used for matching but is not persisted in the Analysis profile.

## Deployment

Build the frontend with `npm run build` and serve `dist/` from a static host. Deploy the Node API as a separate service with the same environment variables and a production MongoDB connection. Set `CLIENT_URL` to the deployed frontend origin, use HTTPS, and set `NODE_ENV=production` so auth cookies are secure. Configure the Gemini key only in the backend deployment secret store.

## Demo flow

1. Start `npm run dev:full`.
2. Open the dashboard and choose **Try demo**.
3. Review the deterministic score, matched skills, missing AWS/Docker/TypeScript requirements, and evidence rows.
4. Upload a PDF/DOCX and paste a role description to exercise the authenticated path after registering a user.

## Current limitations

Resume parsing is intentionally conservative and text-based. Scanned/image-only PDFs need OCR before they can be analyzed. The core P0 comparison path is implemented; resume rewriting, interview generation, PDF report export, and version diffing remain follow-up product modules rather than mocked as complete features.
